# odometry-simulator

A simulation built using Unity Engine in order to simulate a robot on a flat plane with tracking wheels. Using virtual tracking wheel encoders, the simulation calculates the heading angle of the robot, and then uses the x and y translations of the robot in order to return the real-time position of the robot in a flat plane. This way of calculating position is especially useful for autonomous robots that need to track their position in a given environment without using a GPS system.
